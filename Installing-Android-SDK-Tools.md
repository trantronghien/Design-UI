The Android software development kit (SDK) includes different components, including SDK Tools, Build Tools, and Platform Tools.  The SDK Tools primarily includes the stock Android emulator, [hierarchy viewer](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/hierarchy-viewer.html), [SDK manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/update.html), and [[ProGuard|Configuring Proguard]].  The Build Tools primarily include `aapt` (Android packaging tool to create `.APK`), `dx` (Android tool that converts .java files to `.dex` files), or the new [Jack/Jill toolchain](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/jackandjill).  Platform Tools include the [Android debug shell](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html), [sqlite3](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/sqlite3.html) and [Systrace](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/systrace-commandline.html).

The Android SDK can be installed automatically using [Jake Wharton's SDK Plugin](https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin) or downloading the Android SDK manually in several different ways. Below is an overview of all different approaches.

## Installing the Android SDK (Automated Way)

You can use [Jake Wharton's SDK Manager](https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin) to manage all missing SDK dependencies.  It is particularly useful for simplifying the steps of retrieving the Build Tools, SDK version, or support libraries used in your project.      

Edit your root `build.gradle` file to include this plugin.  Because the latest plugin version has not been released to a Maven repository in awhile, we can use [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/) to grab the latest version as described [here](https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/issues/73#issuecomment-106747867).  The old version attempts to download an Android SDK Manager that does not include ProGuard as noted in this [issue](https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin/issues/57).

```gradle
buildscript {
  repositories {
    jcenter()
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.3.1'
    // download commit hash 220bf7
    classpath 'com.github.JakeWharton:sdk-manager-plugin:220bf7a88a7072df3ed16dc8466fb144f2817070'
  }
}
```

The `android-sdk-manager` plugin needs to be declared before the regular `com.android.application` plugin is applied.  If you have [multiple subprojects](http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html) used in your app, make sure every `build.gradle` has this dependency included.

```gradle
apply plugin: 'android-sdk-manager' // run before com.android.application
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
```

If you wish to also download a specific emulator, add this section too:
```gradle
// optionally including an emulator
sdkManager {
  emulatorVersion 'android-19'
  emulatorArchitecture 'armeabi-v7a' // optional, defaults to arm
}
```

When the SDK Manager plug-in runs, it will look at the `local.properties` file to see where the Android SDK files are located.  If this file does not exist, it will attempt to check the environment variable `ANDROID_HOME` for the location.  If it does not find one defined, it will create a directory in `~/.android-sdk`.  In any case, you will want to make sure that that the build has permissions to write to whichever directory if any new packages need to be downloaded.

If you are having any issues with this -plugin, you can run `gradlew build -d` to help see the verbose logging messages.  

### Installing for Ubuntu Linux 

If you are using Ubuntu 15.04 or 15.10, make sure to install the following packages.  Otherwise, you may notice `No such file or directory` when running trying to execute the `aapt` program that is part of the Android SDK toolset:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386 lib32z1 default-jdk
```

## Installing the Android SDK (via Homebrew)

Assuming you have OS X running, you can use Homebrew to install the Android SDK.

1. [Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) - package manager for OSX
2. run `brew install android-sdk`

This will install the Android SDK tools in `/usr/local/Cellar/android-sdk/<version number>`

## Installing the Android SDK (Manual Way)

You wlil need to download the Android SDK without Android Studio bundled. Go to [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and navigate to the **SDK Tools Only** section. Copy the URL for the download that's appropriate for your build machine OS.

![List of Android SDK downloads from developers.android.com](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10808663/gradle_jenkins_android/sdk_downloads.png)

Use `wget` with the correct SDK URL:

    $ wget http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r22.6.2-macosx.zip

Unzip and place the contents within your home directory. The directory names can be anything you like, but save the files in somewhere easy to find (i.e. ~/android-sdk).

 ![Directory structure on the build server](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10808663/gradle_jenkins_android/directories_on_build_server.png)

Now it's time to set your build environment's `PATH` variable and other variables that will be use to locate Android.

Edit your `.bash_profile` file. If you're not using bash, edit the right config file for your environment.

    # Android 
    export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/ciandroid/android-sdk-macosx
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools

 
Save and quit. Reload `.bash_profile`:

    $ source ~/.bash_profile

### Installing via the GUI
 
At the prompt, type `android` and hit Enter to launch the Android SDK Manager in a window. If this doesn't work, your `PATH` variable has not been set up with the Android SDK location.

You will want to install the same Android SDK packages on your build machine as you did to get Gradle running locally. Before you begin, take a look at the `build.gradle` file in your project.

#### Packages to install

Here are the SDK package names you'll definitely wish to select:

  * `Tools > Android SDK Tools`
  * `Tools > Android SDK Platform-tools`
  * `Tools > Android SDK Build-tools`
  * One version of the Android Platform.  E.g., `Android 5.1.1 (API 22)`.  It should be the one you named named in the `android: compileSdkVersion` section of your `build.gradle` file.

You will also want to download the extras:

  * Android Support Repository
  * Android Support Library

Note: Choose the Android SDK Build-tools for the version of Android that you listed in the `build.gradle` file as the `android: buildToolsVersion` target. If your `build.gradle` says 

```gradle
    android {
        buildToolsVersion '21'
        ...
    }
```

then make sure to download that API version in the Android SDK Manager. 

#### Installing via the Command Line

You can also download the SDK packages using the command line with the `--no-ui` parameter.

```
android update sdk --no-ui --all
```

If you want to be selective about installing, you can use `android list` to view all the packages and apply the `--filter` option for selective installs:

```
sudo android update sdk --no-ui --filter platform-tools,tools
```

If you decide to be selective about which packages to be installed, make sure to include the extra Android Maven repository.  Otherwise, you may not be able to use the latest [[support design library|Design Support Library]].

```
android update sdk --no-ui --all --filter extra-android-m2repository     
```

There is currently no filter to install the build tools directly.  See this [ticket](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=78765) for more information.
